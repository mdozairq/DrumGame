Drum Game


This is simple Mini Project in which I played with Java Script eventListener

I have added Buttons for each notes of Drum in my HTML

In each Button added the background Images for the types of Drum by CSS

and Finally Added the eventListener to each button so that it can play the prospective sound


Technology used - HTML, CSS, JS
